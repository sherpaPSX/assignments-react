# Client app

The client application contains some basic setup and UI components you should need.
Consider the existing UI components as _pure components_ responsible only for the visual representation.
Components responsible for the data fetching/manipulating as well as for the keeping of the state have to be implemented.

## Storybook

The application comes with Storybook and stories for the UI components. To run the Storybook execute `pnpm dev:storybook`.
