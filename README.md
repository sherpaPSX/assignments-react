## 📝 Assignment Tasks

Complete all the tasks below.

### Client Application

More information about the client are in the `client/README.md`. Make sure you read them.

Using the provided UI components, implement the following modifications, bugfixes or new features (you can decide in what order):

#### Bugs

- [ ] **B1**: `List` content
  - Fix the content alignment of the non-empty `List` component.
- [ ] **B2**: `Footer` alignment
  - Fix the `Layout` component so the `Footer` is always attached to the bottom of the `Layout`.

_Fix all other bugs and visual imperfections you find._

#### Features

- [ ] **F1**: Default values in `Footer`
  - Modify the counters in `Footer` to show 0 when no value(s) are passed.
- [ ] **F2**: Load todo items
  - After opening the application, todo items should be loaded from the server
  - The todo items should be displayed in the `List` component.
- [ ] **F3**: Add a todo item
  - Implement logic, which toggles visibility between the "add" button in the `Header` and a `Form` component.
  - Entering a value inside the `Form` component and submitting it should create a new todo item.
  - Data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
- [ ] **F4**: Edit a todo item's label
  - Implement logic, which toggles visibility between the "edit" button in the `ListItem` and a `Form` component.
  - Entering a value inside the `Form` component and submitting it should edit the existing todo item.
  - Changes to the data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
- [ ] **F5**: Complete a todo item
  - After clicking on the checkbox in the `ListItem`, the todo item should toggle between "done" and "todo" states.
  - Changes to the data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
- [ ] **F6**: Delete a todo item
  - After clicking the "delete" button in the `ListItem`, the todo item should be deleted.
  - Changes to the data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
- [ ] **F7**: Sort the todo items
  - Sort the list of the todo items:
    - "todo" items (not "done") should be displayed first,
    - after that, items should be sorted by their creation date, descending.
- [ ] **F8**: Count the todo items
  - Show a number of the "todo"/"done" items in the `Footer`.
- [ ] **F9**: `Button` component
  - Create a `Button` component and use it instead of HTML `button` elements.

#### Styling

- [ ] **UI1**: `Header` "add" button alignment
  - The "add" button should be aligned to the right in the `Header` component.
- [ ] **UI2**: `ListItem` actions alignment
  - Action buttons in the `ListItem` component should be aligned to the right.
- [ ] **UI3**: `ListItem` actions visibility
  - Action buttons in the `ListItem` component should be visible only when hovering over the `ListItem`.

#### Stories

- [ ] **SB1**: Add a story/stories for the `Layout` component.
- [ ] **SB2**: Add stories showing available `Button` variants.
- [ ] **SB3**: Add a story showcasing the `ListItem` actions visibility change on hover (implemented in _"UI3"_).

### Server

- [ ] **S1**: Implement a custom endpoint for marking single todo item as "done". Calling this endpoint sets the `done` field to `true` and the `finishedAt` field to current time. Use this new endpoint in the client.

### Advanced Tasks (optional)

- [ ] **O1**: Modify the `Form` component (and other related components if needed) so the form field handles not only string values, but also number. Treat empty string input as `undefined`.
- [ ] **O2**: Limit the amount of server calls needed to a necessary minimum.

## Additional Comments

- Feel free to do any visual modifications that - in your opinion - improve the design of the application.
- Feel free to install and use any public package you may need.

### GitHub

- Do your best to use atomic commits.
- In each commit that solves (fully or partly) one of the tasks above, add the task's id into the commit message. For example: _"B1: fix typo in ..."_.

### Storybook

- We use the Storybook's format CSF3, but you can use the older version of the CSF format if you are more familiar with it.
